        <h2>History :-</h2>
        <p>
           <div>
            The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a Triveni Sangam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soma, the Moon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is said to be the waxing and waning of the moon.

        <h2>My Experience of Discovering Somnath :-</h2>
        <p>
            Temple complex I think is the second biggest among all Jyotirlingas after Rameswaram. The temple is large and fantastic made with red stone. But the most ultimate scene is view of the great Somnath Jyotirlinga. It’s large and my eyes couldn’t move to any other thing as long as we were there. The best thing which happened was we were at the time of Pooja and Aarti at 7.00 pm. First the local Pandit decorated the lingam and then after 15 mins Aarti Started. The Aarti music was so great and loud that it created vibrations around the hall. When I remember that sound it still creates vibrations in me.
